# NvimConfig

The 'autoload/' directory is untracked because it is added automatically when vim-plug is installed and it has it's own git repo.
Thus, when you restore all of nvim configurations you need to install vim-plug which is done through the following command:
  curl -fLo ~/.config/nvim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
